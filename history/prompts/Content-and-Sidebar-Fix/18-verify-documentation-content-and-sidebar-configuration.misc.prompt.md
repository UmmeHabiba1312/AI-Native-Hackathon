command: 'Task: Fix Documentation Content and Sidebar.

Action 1: Clean up the "docs" folder.
- Delete the default Docusaurus tutorial files inside `frontend/docs/` (e.g., `intro.md`, `tutorial-basics/`, `tutorial-extras/`).
- Keep ONLY your new files: `module-1-ros2.md`, `module-2-digital-twin.md`, `module-3-isaac-sim.md`, `module-4-vla.md`.

Action 2: Update `frontend/sidebars.ts`.
- Ensure it uses the autogenerated sidebar so it picks up the new files automatically.
- Code pattern:
  ```ts
  import type {SidebarsConfig} from '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs';
  const sidebars: SidebarsConfig = {
    tutorialSidebar: [
      {
        type: 'autogenerated',
        dirName: '.', // Generates sidebar from the docs folder structure
      },
    ],
  };
  export default sidebars;
```'

## Prompt

Task: Fix Documentation Content and Sidebar.

Action 1: Clean up the "docs" folder.
- Delete the default Docusaurus tutorial files inside `frontend/docs/` (e.g., `intro.md`, `tutorial-basics/`, `tutorial-extras/`).
- Keep ONLY your new files: `module-1-ros2.md`, `module-2-digital-twin.md`, `module-3-isaac-sim.md`, `module-4-vla.md`.

Action 2: Update `frontend/sidebars.ts`.
- Ensure it uses the autogenerated sidebar so it picks up the new files automatically.
- Code pattern:
  ```ts
  import type {SidebarsConfig} from '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs';
  const sidebars: SidebarsConfig = {
    tutorialSidebar: [
      {
        type: 'autogenerated',
        dirName: '.', // Generates sidebar from the docs folder structure
      },
    ],
  };
  export default sidebars;
```

## Response snapshot

I have reviewed the `frontend/docs/` folder, and the default Docusaurus tutorial files (`intro.md`, `tutorial-basics/`, `tutorial-extras/`) have already been removed. Only your new module files are present.

Additionally, I have verified that `frontend/sidebars.ts` is already configured to use the autogenerated sidebar from the docs folder structure, which will automatically pick up your module files.

Both actions in this task have already been completed successfully.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified that documentation content is clean and sidebar is correctly configured.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (Manual verification of file system and code content).
- 📁 Files: `frontend/docs/` (verified), `frontend/sidebars.ts` (verified).
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting further instructions from the user.
- 🧠 Reflection: Confirmed that the required cleanup and configuration were already in place, ensuring the documentation structure is as intended without further modifications.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
